			<h1>About French Bulldogs</h1>
			<p>French Bulldogs, otherwise known as "Frenchies" are the best pets anyone could ever have. They are similar to an English Bulldog, or Pug. The French Bulldog was bred to be like a "toy-sized" bulldog. They would go to work with the lacemakers in France, during the industrial revolution and sit by their feet.
			<br />
			<p>Frenchies are most popular for their "bat-ears" and "squished face." Their faces actually cause their breathing to be different from other dogs with long snouts. It makes it a bit harder for them to breathe heavily. This is why you may not see a French Bulldog on walks, in cars, or even in planes. Frenchies are not very good swimmers because their heads are just so big and heavy! They love to be lazy and relax. They typically only weigh up to 25lbs and are great with children. 
			<br />
			<p>Because French Bulldogs are sometimes difficult to take care of, many people cannot care for them and give them a good home. If you think you or your family would be interested in rescuing a Frenchie, please visit one of the sites below!</p>
